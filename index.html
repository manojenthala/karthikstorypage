            Real-time data analysis is revolutionizing agriculture, allowing farmers to make informed decisions about crop management, irrigation, and pest control.Satellite imaging and drone technology provide detailed insights into crop health and soil conditions, optimizing yields while minimizing environmental impact.This ushered in India's Green Revolution. It began with the decision to adopt superior yielding, disease resistant wheat varieties in combination with better farming knowledge to improve productivity. The state of Punjab led India's green revolution and earned the distinction of being the country's breadbasket.
